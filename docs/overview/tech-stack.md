# Tech stack

The tech stack that Volca is built on was chosen with the following in mind:

- Speed - When building a SaaS product, you want to be able to ship new features to customers quickly
- Reliability - To make sure your users keep using your product, you want to be using reliable and proven technology
- Scalability - Start from 0 and scale to thousands of users without worrying about manually scaling your infrastructure
- Extensibility - Start with a simple project structure that a single developer can navigate and extend it to a development environment that can support hundreds of developers
- Cost - Don't spend hundreds of dollars up front on infrastructure, let your costs scale with the number of customers
