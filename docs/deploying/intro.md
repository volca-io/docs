# Introduction

The first step to get your environment up and running is to follow this guide for each environment that you want to deploy. After this has been completed, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy any new changes that you push to your repository. We recommend setting up a `staging` and a `production` environment. This guide uses `staging` as an example.

You can either use a custom domain or an AWS provided domain.
