# Without custom domain

If you don't have a domain yet, you can still deploy your application. You will then have to use the automatically generated domains from CloudFront and API Gateway.

1. Make sure no domain is configured in `app.config.ts`, .e.g.

```ts title="app.config.ts"
export const config: Config = {
  ...
  environments: {
    staging: {
      ...
      domain: "", // Leave this empty
      ...
    },
  },
};

```

2. Then run the following command

```sh
yarn infra:deploy -s <environment>
```

3. Once the deployment is complete, you can locate the domain generated by CloudFront by going to Services -> CloudFront -> Select your CloudFront distribution -> Distribution domain name

Open the domain in your browser and try it out!
